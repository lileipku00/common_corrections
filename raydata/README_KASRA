-------------25.02.2014 (Kasra)
* NOT CHANGED:
azdel.f
raytracesubs.f
selectISC.f
README
ellip.f ---> MINOR differences in writing and debugging
Examples

* NEW FILES:
README_KASRA ---> This file!
makeraydata ---> CHANGE IT...Compile all the required libraries

OBSOLETE ---> Obsolete files (not used anymore!)

libsun.f       ---> BLNK ellipticity correction (from website!)
libtau.f       ---> BLNK ellipticity correction (from website!)
ttlim.inc      ---> BLNK ellipticity correction (from website!)
elcordir.tbl   ---> BLNK ellipticity correction (from website!)
ellip_blnk.f90 ---> BLNK ellipticity correction (from website!)

* MODIFIED:
raydata.f:
- make some printings on the screen (user-friendly!)
- Ellipticity correction using BLN Kennett's method (for Pdiff)
- Comparison between two methods of ellipticity correction
- Pdiff: BLNK method should be used
Otherwise, they will be compared and if the error is more than
10% then it will stop the program....
- Pdiff is modeled by PPPP (to get correct lat, lon)
we do not want to write all the corrections
for all the legs
here only 1, 2, 9 are written and the rest are omitted!
- We have already considered the effects of attenuation in
our forward modeling (YSPEC or AXISEM) ---> t*=0.
- In case of Pdiff: We do not want to write all the sensitivity kernels
since we are modeling Pdiff with PPPP ---> so just the first
line
